> 1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

> 2 I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.

> 3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.

> 4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

> 5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;

> 6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.

> 7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

> 8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.

> 9 Because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;

> 10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.

> 11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.

> 12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.

> 13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

> 14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

> 15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

> 16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.      
-- Psalm 91
