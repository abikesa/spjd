*There's an email chain between Dr. Sarah E. Kayongo, Patrick E. Muinda, Martin J. Muwaga, and Abimereki D. Muzaale (henceforth SPJD). They are discussing and scheduling a 4-way call to take place at mutually convenient times, considering different time zones. Two main topics are planned for discussion: supporting the "bazeeyi's" cash flow and establishing a feedback/support session for Patrick's doctoral studies. After several exchanges to agree on a suitable time, the meeting is eventually scheduled for 8 pm KLA time on May 3, 2021. Dr. Kayongo also shares a Zoom link for the meeting.*
